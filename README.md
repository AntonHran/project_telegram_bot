This Telegram bot has the following functionality, which is already implemented:

- At the first launch, the user can choose the language (English or Ukrainian) for further use of the bot.
- The user can choose the categories that interest him, in particular:
   - Motivational phrases.
   - Weather forecast.
   - Trends.
   - News.
   - Random article.

- The News category has sections like Business, Entertainment, General, Health, Science, Sports, Technology. The user can also select the desired country for news.
- Users can provide additional information such as city, country and preferred time of sending messages for other categories.
- All user settings are stored in a JSON file.

However, there are some features that still need to be implemented:

- Database connections: It is necessary to create tables containing information about user settings, as well as record data about new connections to the database.
- Working with the database: It is necessary to implement the logic that will be responsible for working with the database. For example, this logic can periodically check users' settings and send them messages according to the selected time.
- Additional functions: expand the functionality of the bot by adding new features, such as interacting with users through commands, creating notifications or scheduled messages: 
  - The "search" command: The user can use the "search" command to independently search for news by various parameters, such as topic, language, year, publisher. This gives the user enhanced opportunities to find specific news that interests him.

  - Category "Books": The category "Books" has been added, in which the user can receive news or offers from the world of journalism. This allows you to expand the informational content sent to the user.

  - Changing the language: The user can change the language while using the bot, which allows you to conveniently adapt the content to your own requirements and preferences.

  - News monitoring: The bot monitors news regarding the selected categories throughout the day and sends them to users as they are received. This ensures that information is constantly updated and relevant news is sent without being limited to one-off or preset sending times.
